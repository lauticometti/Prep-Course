          <h3 class="experiencie__coder-title">Academy project - Space Tourism</h3>
          <p>While I was learning about website development, I was applying that knowledge to a project called Space Tourism. I took the design from Frontend Mentor, and I was in charge of doing the layout and styles. For the first time, I connected GIT with Github and implemented SCSS. The big challenge here was implementing a CSS-only slider and making it look good on all screen sizes.</p>

      <h2 class="code-path__title">My path</h2>
      <p class="code-path__paragraph">All begin when I was 16. I saw a tweet. I start making a Python mini-course. Then, I got my computer broken and I was two years without touch a keyboard. At the while, in my free-time, I used watch on Youtube many videos about programming. I was looking for the best way to get started and all suggested to me I should got a computer and learn web development.
      </p>
      <p class="code-path__paragraph">At april of 2022, I finally bought my pc and start my practice. I has an all night job, and I only has a couple hours to code for day. So, I decided that the best thing I could make were: purchase an course, come back to live with my dad and center my attention in this. That was I did, and now I'm ready for Henry Challenge and start learning Javascript for get a new tech job.
